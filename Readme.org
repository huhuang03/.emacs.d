* Introduce
  Myself emacs config file

* Some though
** use ctrl + space to lead to custom key bindings.
For now I use space as lead key and only works in evil-normal-state

How about use ctrl + sapce as lead key in emacs all state?

The key package is general

Can I provide the basic binding and can switch by only modify only one place?
